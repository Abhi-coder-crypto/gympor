[x] 15. Fixed habits not appearing on client dashboard - Issue: Client page was using direct fetch with localStorage token instead of proper apiRequest auth. Solution: (1) Updated client-habits.tsx to use apiRequest function with proper authentication headers from queryClient, (2) Changed queryKey from ["habits", clientId] to ["/api/habits/client", clientId] for consistency, (3) Updated trainer-habits.tsx mutation to explicitly invalidate the specific client's habits cache after assignment. This ensures habits assigned by trainers are immediately visible on client dashboard with proper MongoDB ObjectId matching.
[x] 16. Completed comprehensive debugging and fixes for habits and trainer contact issues - (1) Enhanced /api/habits/client/:clientId endpoint with robust ObjectId/string handling and comprehensive logging to identify data mismatches. (2) Fixed cache invalidation in trainer-habits.tsx for both create and delete mutations to properly invalidate client-specific habit queries. (3) Verified trainer-contact-dialog.tsx implementation is correct: displays email for all packages and phone+WhatsApp/Call for Pro/Elite only. (4) Verified TrainerContactDropdown is properly integrated in client-header.tsx for both desktop and mobile views. (5) Application fully deployed with all authentication flows working correctly. All habits assigned by trainers should now display on client dashboard immediately.
