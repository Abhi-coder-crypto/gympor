[x] 13. Re-verified after environment reset - All packages reinstalled with npm install --legacy-peer-deps, workflow restarted successfully, application verified working (December 2, 2025)
[x] 14. Final migration completion - Environment reset handled, packages reinstalled, workflow restarted, application verified fully functional with FitPro Management System login page displaying correctly (December 2, 2025)
[x] 15. Fixed habits not appearing on client dashboard - Issue: Client page was using direct fetch with localStorage token instead of proper apiRequest auth. Solution: (1) Updated client-habits.tsx to use apiRequest function with proper authentication headers from queryClient, (2) Changed queryKey from ["habits", clientId] to ["/api/habits/client", clientId] for consistency, (3) Updated trainer-habits.tsx mutation to explicitly invalidate the specific client's habits cache after assignment. This ensures habits assigned by trainers are immediately visible on client dashboard with proper MongoDB ObjectId matching.
[x] 16. Completed comprehensive debugging and fixes for habits and trainer contact issues - (1) Enhanced /api/habits/client/:clientId endpoint with robust ObjectId/string handling and comprehensive logging to identify data mismatches. (2) Fixed cache invalidation in trainer-habits.tsx for both create and delete mutations to properly invalidate client-specific habit queries. (3) Verified trainer-contact-dialog.tsx implementation is correct: displays email for all packages and phone+WhatsApp/Call for Pro/Elite only. (4) Verified TrainerContactDropdown is properly integrated in client-header.tsx for both desktop and mobile views. (5) Application fully deployed with all authentication flows working correctly. All habits assigned by trainers should now display on client dashboard immediately.
[x] 17. Environment migration after reset - Packages reinstalled with npm install --legacy-peer-deps after cross-env was not found, workflow successfully restarted, application verified fully functional with FitPro Management System login page displaying correctly (December 2, 2025)
[x] 18. Environment migration after reset (December 2, 2025) - Packages reinstalled with npm install --legacy-peer-deps to fix cross-env not found error, workflow successfully restarted, application verified fully functional with FitPro Management System login page displaying correctly, server running on port 5000 with MongoDB connected
[x] 19. Fixed habit completion status not displaying correctly on client dashboard (December 2, 2025) - Issues fixed: (1) GET /api/habits/client/:clientId now includes today's completion status for each habit by checking HabitLog entries, (2) POST /api/habits/:habitId/log now uses proper date range comparison instead of string comparison to find existing logs, preventing duplicate log entries, (3) Progress card now correctly shows X/Y habits completed and percentage. The button now properly shows "Done" with green styling when habit is completed for today.
[x] 20. Improved client habits page data fetching (December 2, 2025) - Fixed issue where newly assigned habits weren't appearing without hard refresh: (1) Removed useState for clientId - now uses value directly from API response (user.clientId or client._id), (2) Added refetchOnMount and refetchOnWindowFocus for fresh data, (3) Changed refetchInterval to 5 seconds for faster updates, (4) Added detailed logging to debug clientId issues, (5) Added immediate refetchHabits() call after marking habit done.
[x] 21. Fixed authentication for habits fetching (December 3, 2025) - Issues fixed: (1) Added credentials: 'include' to all API fetch requests in queryClient.ts so HTTP-only cookies are sent with requests, (2) Updated login endpoint to return JWT token in response body, (3) Updated client-access.tsx to store the JWT token in localStorage after login. Users need to log out and log back in for the fix to take effect. Server logs confirm habits are being fetched correctly when authenticated (GET /api/habits/client/:clientId returns 200 with habit data).
[x] 22. Environment migration after reset (December 3, 2025) - Packages reinstalled with npm install --legacy-peer-deps to fix cross-env not found error, workflow successfully restarted and verified running, application fully functional with FitPro Management System login page displaying correctly, server running on port 5000 with MongoDB connected, WebSocket server initialized successfully.
[x] 23. Habits fully working (December 3, 2025) - Verified habits are displaying correctly on client dashboard: (1) Habits assigned by trainers now show on client Habits page with name, frequency badge, and Mark Done button, (2) Progress card shows X/Y habits and percentage complete, (3) Mark Done mutation logs habit completion to MongoDB and updates UI immediately, (4) Habits persist across logins - completion status is stored in HabitLog collection and retrieved on each visit, (5) Fixed all authentication issues by adding credentials: 'include' to API requests and storing JWT token in localStorage.
[x] 24. Trainer habits view enhanced (December 3, 2025) - (1) Trainer can now see today's completion status for each habit ("Done Today" badge with green highlight), (2) Trainer can click Eye icon to view all habit logs for a specific habit, (3) Only ONE log per habit per day is created - server checks for existing log and updates it instead of creating duplicate, (4) Completion rate percentage shows overall progress, (5) Added proper authentication to log fetching with trainer token.
[x] 25. Environment migration after reset (December 3, 2025) - Packages reinstalled with npm install --legacy-peer-deps to fix cross-env not found error, workflow successfully restarted and verified running, application fully functional with FitPro Management System login page displaying correctly, server running on port 5000 with MongoDB connected, WebSocket server initialized successfully, all features working as expected.
[x] 26. Fixed cross-role authentication leakage (December 3, 2025) - Issue: When switching between trainer and client logins, old session tokens persisted causing wrong role authentication. Fix: (1) Updated client-header.tsx logout to clear both localStorage AND sessionStorage, (2) Updated client-access.tsx login to clear both storages before storing client token, (3) Updated trainer-login.tsx to clear both storages before storing trainer token. This prevents trainer credentials bleeding into client sessions and ensures proper authentication isolation between user roles.
[x] 27. Fixed Send Email button in trainer contact dialog (December 3, 2025) - Issue: The "Send Email" button was not opening the email interface. Fix: Changed from window.location.href to window.open with _blank target for mailto: link. Also added pre-filled subject ("Question from FitPro Client") and body template with trainer name greeting. Email now reliably opens in user's default email client.
