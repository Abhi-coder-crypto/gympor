You already have full access to my project's source code, backend logic, frontend, and existing MongoDB structure.

Your task:
CHECK the complete CRM implementation according to the full requirement list I provided.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Use ONLY the existing admin and trainer accounts to test.
- Use ONLY the clients already present in the MongoDB database.
- DO NOT create new fields.
- DO NOT add hardcoded values.
- DO NOT generate demo data.
- Only test using existing real data from MongoDB.
- ONLY check implementation and functionality.
- At the end, list exactly which features are missing, incomplete, or not functioning.

==========================================
CHECK THE FOLLOWING ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED:

1️⃣ **CLIENT PORTAL FEATURES**
- Dashboard & overview functionality
- Workout management features
- Diet & nutrition system
- Advanced nutrition calculators
- Live training/session booking
- Progress tracking & analytics
- Goal setting system
- Profile & settings
- Communication tools

2️⃣ **ADMIN & TRAINER PORTAL FEATURES**
- Dashboards & analytics
- Client management
- Video/workout library system
- Diet plan creation & assignment
- Live session management
- Revenue & payments system

3️⃣ **TECHNICAL + BACKEND FEATURES**

- Zoom/Meet scheduling setup from admin
- All required backend endpoints working
- All client/admin/trainer pages loading with real data

==========================================
YOUR WORK NOW:

1. Go through the entire project codebase.
2. Use existing MongoDB data to load every page and feature.
3. Test the entire CRM flow:
   - Admin → Trainer → Client cycle
   - Client dashboard & all features
   - Admin management features
   - Trainer management features

4. For EVERY feature I listed:
   - Check if it exists.
   - Check if it is implemented properly.
   - Check if it works using the current database.
   - Check if the UI, backend, and database are aligned.

5. Do NOT modify anything.
6. Do NOT populate any data.
7. Do NOT create mock data.
8. ONLY validate and report.

==========================================
FINAL OUTPUT REQUIRED:

Provide a structured list:

A) **Fully Implemented Features**  
B) **Partially Implemented Features**  
C) **Missing or Not Implemented Features** (most important output)

For missing features:
- Only list them.
- Do NOT propose solutions.
- Do NOT add fields.
- Do NOT generate code unless I ask later.

This is a QA/verification task ONLY.
